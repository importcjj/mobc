Inspired by r2d2 and Golang SQL package.

## Examples

More [examples](https://github.com/importcjj/mobc/tree/master/mobc-foo/examples)

Using an imaginary "foodb" database.

```rust
use mobc::{async_trait, Manager};

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct FooError;

pub struct FooConnection;

impl FooConnection {
    pub async fn query(&self) -> String {
        "PONG".to_string()
    }
}

pub struct FooManager;

#[async_trait]
impl Manager for FooManager {
    type Connection = FooConnection;
    type Error = FooError;

    async fn connect(&self) -> Result<Self::Connection, Self::Error> {
        Ok(FooConnection)
    }

    async fn check(&self, conn: Self::Connection) -> Result<Self::Connection, Self::Error> {
        Ok(conn)
    }
}
```

## Configures

#### max_open
Sets the maximum number of connections managed by the pool.
>0 means unlimited, defaults to 10.

#### min_idle
Sets the maximum idle connection count maintained by the pool. The pool will maintain at most this many idle connections at all times, while respecting the value of max_open.

#### max_lifetime
Sets the maximum lifetime of connections in the pool. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse.
>None meas reuse forever, defaults to None.

#### get_timeout
Sets the get timeout used by the pool. Calls to Pool::get will wait this long for a connection to become available before returning an error. 
>None meas never timeout, defaults to 30 seconds.


## Variable

Some of the connection pool configurations can be adjusted dynamically. Each connection pool instance has the following methods:

* set_max_open_conns
* set_max_idle_conns
* set_conn_max_lifetime

## Stats
* max_open - Maximum number of open connections to the database.
* connections - The number of established connections both in use and idle.
* in_use - The number of connections currently in use.
* idle - The number of idle connections.
* wait_count - The total number of connections waited for.
* wait_duration - The total time blocked waiting for a new connection.
* max_idle_closed - The total number of connections closed due to max_idle.
* max_lifetime_closed - The total number of connections closed due to max_lifetime.

## Compatibility
Because tokio is not compatible with other runtimes, such as async-std. So a database driver written with tokio cannot run in the async-std runtime. For example, you can't use redis-rs in tide because it uses tokio, so the connection pool which bases on redis-res can't be used in tide either.
